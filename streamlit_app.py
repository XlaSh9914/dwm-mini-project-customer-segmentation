'''

In this project, we are developing a decision tree model to segment customers based on key features from credit card data, specifically *balance*, *purchases*, and *credit limit*. By using these features, we aim to predict customer tenure, which is classified into *short-term*, *mid-term*, and *long-term* categories. This model can assist businesses in understanding customer behavior and tailoring marketing strategies accordingly.

Our approach is inspired by the research conducted in the paper titled ["Study on Application of Customer Segmentation Based on Data Mining Technology"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5235679) (DOI: 10.1109/ICCSA.2009.56), which discusses various data mining techniques applied to fraud detection in financial systems. We adapt their methodologies for customer segmentation, focusing on building an efficient decision tree classifier for better customer insights.
